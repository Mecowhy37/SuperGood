				<p>What we create starts at the soil. We partner with local farmers to source our ingredients ogranic and local-when-possible to be familiar with the growing practices and ensure we are getting quality produce grown in a sustainable manner. We also help local farmers reduce food waste to bring you farm-to-frozen goodness.</p>
